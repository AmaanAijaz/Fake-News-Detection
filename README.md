# Fake-News-Detection


This project belongs to the domain of Data Science

The project involves training a model based o the dataset obtained on kaggle, (link:- https://www.kaggle.com/c/fake-news/data ).

The data is of the form of a CSV file before the machine is trained on it.

This classification model aims at the classification of news as legitimate or a hoax based on classification techniques with frequency vectorizer.

Using scikit learn, a TfidfVectorizer (for numerical representation of text strings) was built on the dataset

A PassiveAggressive Classifier was initialized and fit the mode
